# .NET Core 2.0.0 {sdkorruntime}

This package installs the .NET Core 2.0 {sdkorruntime} for your platform and provides the `dotnet` executable.

No elevation/root required.

Partners with the [dotnet{flavor}2.0.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotnet{flavor}2.0.0) package.

Usable as a standalone but also for shipping .NET based packages:

## Scenario 1: Global Installation

To make the `dotnet` command available globally, run

``` Haskell seems to provide nice highlighting
npm i -g dotnet-2.0.0      // for running dotnet apps
npm i -g dotnet-sdk-2.0.0  // for developing dotnet apps
```

## Scenario 2: Dependency

When installed as a dependency of a package, the `dotnet` command will be available to that package's `scripts`.
This enables a very simple development and shipping experience for platform-independent .NET based applications.

### Example

The following `package.json` uses both the `dotnet-sdk-2.0.0` and `dotnet-2.0.0` in order to simplify both developing and shipping the package.

``` json
{
  "name": "contoso",
  "version": "1.33.7",
  "description": "Contoso C# app",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "dotnet build src/contoso.csproj",
    "test": "dotnet test src/contoso.test.csproj",
    "start": "dotnet bin/netcoreapp2.0/contoso.dll"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "dotnet-sdk-2.0.0": "*"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "dotnet-2.0.0": "*"
  }
}
```

This allows consuming the `contoso` package easily as a *standalone* using

``` Haskell seems to provide nice highlighting
npx contoso
```

or when *installed* (e.g. as a dependency of another package) using

``` Haskell seems to provide nice highlighting
npm start
```

Unsurprisingly, during *development* the following commands will work:

``` Haskell seems to provide nice highlighting
npm run build
npm run test
```

## Technical Details

### Platform Independence

We created several *platform-specific* helper packages that actually provide the promised `dotnet` installation (e.g. `dotnet-sdk-2.0.0-win`).
Such packages exist for Windows, Linux and MacOS.
Here, we will merely determine the executing platform, acquire the corresponding package and populate `.bin` with scripts forwarding any calls to the actual binaries.

### Installation Location

The *platform-specific* package (see above) is installed in a *shared location* in order to reliably deduplicate it across installations.
By default, the installation location is `~/.net/2.0.0` since it is accessible without elevation.

### Environment Variables

`DEBUG`  - set to `1` to show debugging messages from the caller/installer scripts

`NO_NET_SDK` - set to `1` to prevent the runtime runner for checking for and deferring to the SDK runner before using just the runtime.

`DOTNET_SHARED_ARCH` - overrides the architecture (one of `osx`, `linux`, `win`, `win-x86`).

`DOTNET_SHARED_HOME` - overrides the base folder for installing dotnet runtimes/sdks. defaults to 
- linux/osx: `~/.net` 
- windows:  `%USERPROFILE%\.net`

### Commands 

Since the .NET core tools and runtime both use a command called `dotnet`, both the runtime and sdk variants of this package do the same.
If you have both installed, it will by default use the SDK which should support the needs of runtime running too.

`dotnet` -- runs the SDK `dotnet` tool if installed, or falls back to running the runtime `dotnet` tool.

`install-dotnet-{sdkorruntime}` -- installs the shared .NET Core {sdkorruntime} if it's not installed. use `--force` to overwrite if necessary

## Troubleshooting

### Unable to install/use dotnet framework
If you are getting the `Unable to install/use dotnet framework` message, try obtaining more details by running the following commands in a Powershell prompt:
```powershell
# clean out anything that might be there
rmdir -recurse $home/.net

# enable debug logs
$env:debug=1
$env:NO_NET_SDK=1

# clean npm cache
npm cache clear --force

# try installing again (2.1 is an example, may differ in your situation)
npm install -g dotnet-2.1 
```
It should dump out debugging data, which can help you find the issue. There may be one or more lines in the logs that start with `{"type":"error"`, which will point you in the right direction.
